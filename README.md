# React + Vite

Display_Color_Changer
Display_Color_Changer is an interactive React application that allows users to dynamically change the background or text color of a display area. Built using React with JSX, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by Vite, this project showcases modern web development practices and responsive UI design.

Key features include dynamic color updates, real-time state management with React hooks, and a clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS. The project is perfect for learning React state management, props usage, and utility-first CSS styling.
